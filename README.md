# How to Run

1. Install [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/) and clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/h4iku/bug-localization.git
    ```

2. Create a venv and install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd bug-localization
    python -m venv env
    ./env/Scripts/activate
    python -m pip install -U pip setuptools
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    Also, download and install the spaCy's [`en_core_web_lg`](https://spacy.io/models/en#en_core_web_lg) pretrained model and [NLTK data](http://www.nltk.org/data.html). From NLTK, only `punkt` and `averaged_perceptron_tagger` are needed that can be downloaded using NLTK Downloader GUI or a Python interpreter:

    ```python
    >>> import nltk
    >>> nltk.download('punkt')
    >>> nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
    ```

3. Download the datasets file from [here](http://www.mediafire.com/file/5x0vjnno666ynst/data.zip/file), and unzip it in the root directory of the cloned repository. You can also download these datasets from the [BugLocator](https://code.google.com/archive/p/bugcenter/downloads) and [BRTracer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/brtracer/files/) repositories. More datasets can be downloaded from the [Bench4BL](https://github.com/exatoa/Bench4BL) repository.

4. Check the path of datasets in `buglocalizer/datasets.py` module and change the value of the `DATASET` variable to choose different datasets (default values can be `aspectj`, `swt`, and `zxing`, but you can add more).

    Run the main module:

    ```bash
    python buglocalizer/main.py
    ```

    All the modules are also independently runnable if it was needed to run them one by one.
